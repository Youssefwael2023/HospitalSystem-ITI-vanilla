  - Services overview

  - Appointment booking form
  - Doctor carousel (shows 3 doctors at a time, slides to show more)
  - News section
  - Contact info
  - Footer

## Technologies Used

## Folder Structure

```
components/
  footer/
  nav/
css/
pages/
  About/
  appoinment/
  contact/
  doctors/

```

- Each page folder contains its own HTML, CSS, JS, and images.
- Shared components (nav, footer) are in the `components` folder.
- Global styles are in the `css` folder.

## How It Works

- **Appointment Form:**

  - First you should be loggedin to make an appoinment
  - Collects user info and stores it in localStorage.
  - Selects doctor and department dynamically from api not hardcoded.

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `pages/home/index.html` in your browser to view the home page.
3. Navigate to other pages using the navbar.
